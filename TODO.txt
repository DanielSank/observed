Things to do soon:
 1. Audit the weak referencing code and make sure it acts the way we've
    advertised. In particular, make sure that being simultaneously
    observed and observer doesn't mess anything up. Obviously this should
    be handled by writing appropriate tests.
 2. Consider whether default weak referencing is even a good idea.
 3. Consider whether storing callback information on the instances
    instead of in the descriptor which manages them. This might be
    necessary to support pickling.
 4. Make a slightly nicer release doc, with contributors and news all
    rolled into one document which is exposed on PyPI.

Things to do ever:
 1. Consider whether or not it's possible to write a single decorator
    which correctly handles functions and methods without pulling the
    tom-foolery I used to make that work in v0.4.
 2. Support observable static and class methods.
